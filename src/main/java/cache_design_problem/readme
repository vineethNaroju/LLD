Low level design for cache. Support 2 operations -
- Put: This will allow user to put a value against a key in cache.
- Get: This will allow user to get a value against a key from cache.
- Eviction: Cache should support eviction of some keys in case cache is full.

Expectations:
1. Code should be functionally correct.
2. Modular & readable - clean and professional level code.
3. Code should be extensible and scalable - accomodate new requirements with minimal changes.
4. Good OOPs design.
